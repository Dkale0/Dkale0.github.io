I am a recent graduate from the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, majoring in Computer Science and Statistics. Currently, I work as a Java Developer at Huntington National Bank, where I contribute to the development and support of a Spring Boot-based commercial banking application. Before this, I interned at Foresight Strategy, where I automated OneDrive indexing, applied NLP for text analysis, and used data visualization for decision-making. While attending UMN, I was part of Gopher Motorsports, where I developed Django applications for inverntory & vehicle configuration tracking. My personal projects include designing a data pipeline for time series analysis and forecasting inflation with Temporal Fusion Transformers.
