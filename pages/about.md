I've recently graduated with dual degrees in Computer Science and Statistics from the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, where I maintained a strong academic record in both fields. My academic journey has equipped me with valuable skills in machine learning, data structures, algorithms, and statistical analysis. During my internship at Foresight Strategy, I had the opportunity to apply my knowledge by automating OneDrive indexing, leveraging NLP tools for text analysis, and using data visualization to facilitate decision-making. As a software developer at Gopher Motorsports, I led the development of a Django application and implemented DevOps practices for efficient deployment. My diverse project portfolio, which includes designing a data pipeline for time series analysis and forecasting inflation using Temporal Fusion Transformers, reflects my passion for technology and data-driven solutions. Proficient in various programming languages and tools, I'm eager to continue my journey in the world of technology and data analysis. Explore my portfolio to delve into my work further, and let's connect for potential collaborations on exciting ventures!
